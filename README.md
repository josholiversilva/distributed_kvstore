# Learn GO Project - Distributed Key Value Store

Nothing too crazy. This project will leverage HTTP to handle key-value items in a distributed environment (rasp pis)   
<br>

1. POST, GET, & DELETE transactions over REST
2. ATOMIC & in-memory storage
3. Distributed across 2 raspberry pis (1 master, 1 slave)
